diary_data.json: Static information on all the achievement diaries in OSRS. This
can be hand-maintained, since it will probably be a very long time before they
release diaries. It contains descriptions, skill requirements, quest requirements, etc.

item_data.json, map.json, quest_data.json: Scraped from runelite via the /cache
package. Needs to be updated as new game caches are uploaded.
